# 1.What is Machine Learning

Computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some specific task F and some performace measure P , if it's performance on T , as measured by P improves with expereince E.

# 2.What is Data Mining

It's a derivative or subproduct of ML experience that teaches humans about the pattenrs it's discovered by the result it's deep experience its gained by the large set of training data which is called Data mining . Minings a earth may result in to finding rare mineral or diamond
if ML algorithm mine data's that its known as Data Mining.

# 3.Can you name a four types of problem where ML shines ?

1. Problem that requires complex rules and unprecendented problem statements
2. static set of rules couldn't resolves a specif problem
3. fluctuating environment : a ML system can adopt to a new system
4. Getting insights about a complex problems and large amount of data

# 4.what is supervised learning

training data sets you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solution called labelsmodals are trained with the data that are labeled attributes . this typical supervisedlearning tasks formly known as classification. In spam detection ML algorithm trained withemails along with their class (spam or ham).

# 5.what is regression task ?

like classifiers which works on training data's labels and predicts the output , regression is predicts the target numeric values. the prediction happened based on attributes like mileage ,age and brand . To train the system you need many example of cars , including predictors and labels (ie. their prices)

```
Note that some regression algorithms can be used for classification as well, and vice
versa. For example, Logistic Regression is commonly used for classification, as it can
output a value that corresponds to the probability of belonging to a given class (e.g.,
20% chance of being spam)

# 6.list some of the most important supervised learning algorithms

1.k-Nearest neighbours
2.Linear regression
3.Logistic regression
4.Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5.Decision Trees and Random Forests
6.Neural Networks

# 7.what is unsupervised learning and give example

algorithms are learn from train data without label or predictors , example a ML algorithm classifies the users of blog

```
For example, say you have a lot of data about your blog’s visitors. You may want to
run a clustering algorithm to try to detect groups of similar visitors. At
no point do you tell the algorithm which group a visitor belongs to: it finds those
connections without your help. For example, it might notice that 40% of your visitors
are males who love comic books and generally read your blog in the evening, while
20% are young sci-fi lovers who visit during the weekends. If you use a hierarchical
clustering algorithm, it may also subdivide each group into smaller groups. This may
help you target your posts for each group.

# 8.list important algorithms

1.clusters - K-Means - DBSCAN - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis

# 8.semisupervised learning

unsupervised learning combined with supervised learning called semisupervised. since labeling dataset is costly , you will often have unlabeled instances and few labeled instances.

# 9. semisupervised learning

Most semisupervised learning algorithms are combinations of unsupervised and
supervised algorithms. For example, deep belief networks (DBNs) are based on unsu‐
pervised components called restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) stacked on top of
one another. RBMs are trained sequentially in an unsupervised manner, and then the
whole system is fine-tuned using supervised learning techniques.

# 10.Reinforcement learning
